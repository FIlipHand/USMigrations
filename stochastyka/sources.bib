  abstract       = {Both climate change and migration present key concerns for global health progress. Despite this, a transparent method for identifying and understanding the relationship between climate change, migration and other contextual factors remains a knowledge gap. Existing conceptual models are useful in understanding the complexities of climate migration, but provide varying degrees of applicability to quantitative studies, resulting in non-homogenous transferability of knowledge in this important area. This paper attempts to provide a critical review of climate migration literature, as well as presenting a new conceptual model for the identification of the drivers of migration in the context of climate change. It focuses on the interactions and the dynamics of drivers over time, space and society. Through systematic, pan-disciplinary and homogenous application of theory to different geographical contexts, we aim to improve understanding of the impacts of climate change on migration. A brief case study of Malawi is provided to demonstrate how this global conceptual model can be applied into local contextual scenarios. In doing so, we hope to provide insights that help in the more homogenous applications of conceptual frameworks for this area and more generally.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a multistage network equilibrium model of human migration. The model provides a general framework for describing the dynamics of populations, and takes advantage of the special network structure of the problem. Unlike earlier network equilibrium models of migration, the model allows for chain migration in that humans can move from location to location in a “chaining” fashion, which is more realistic from an application perspective, than simply allowing for migration from a given origin to a direct destination in a single step. For the purpose of modeling and analysis, we utilize finite state nonhomogeneous Markov chains to handle the migration. A stable population distribution is then shown to exist under certain assumptions.}
